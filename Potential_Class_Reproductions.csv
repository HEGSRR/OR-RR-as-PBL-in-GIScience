Influence of built environment on pedestrian crashes: A network-based GIS analysis,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apgeog.2016.06.005,"Dai, D., & Jaworski, D.",2016,A network-based kernel density technique was used to locate the hotspots of pedestrian crashes. An environmental audit was then conducted to provide a qualitative assessment of the built environment within each hotspot. Bivariate analysis and negative binomial models were utilized to examine the influence quantitatively after the road was partitioned into short road segments.,Network analysis; Network based kernel density estimates,GIS,Human,Urban Geography,Public Websites Linked in Article,Not Applicable,3.5,Not Available,Ignore public audit portion of the analysis

GIS investigation of the fire history of Jonkershoek Nature Reserve,http://dx.doi.org/10.4314/sajg.v11i2.2,"Mashele, S. & Singh, K. ",2022,"Image classification was carried out from 2005 to 2015 to determine the burn patterns, with the process being aided by the fire regime history from 1970 to 2015. Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) analysis was carried out to determine how abiotic factors, such as elevation, slope and aspect, impact fires in the Reserve. The assessment of fires included the ascertainment of their location, coverage, and frequency, the Normalised Burn Ratio (NBR), the differenced Normalised Burn Ratio (dNBR) and the Normalised Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI)","raster calculation, regression",Remote Sensing,Physical,Natural Hazards (Fire),Public Websites Linked in Article,Not Provided,3,Not Available,"Methods are not complicated, but minimal information is provided about data and procedures"
